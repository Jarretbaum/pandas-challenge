# pandas-challenge

The majority resource that I used was just going back and watching recordings from past classes to refresh my memory on which functions or statements and their syntaxes I need to be focusing in on. I received guidance and assistance from a couple online resources, including slack discussions, Stackoverflow, and the OpenAI community in writing this code. There were a couple of things that were not covered at all in class, so I'm not entirely sure if I am executing the code exactly the way you guys are intending us to. My results are accurate which is all that matters to me in this scenario.

Stack Overflow articles that I gathered code, information, or, insight from while tackling this assignment:
